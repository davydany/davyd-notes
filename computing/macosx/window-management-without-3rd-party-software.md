Here’s how:

1. Go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts

2. Hit the plus button and add the Menu Title exactly as it appears along with whichever shortcuts you want:

**Tile Window to Left of Screen** and **Tile Window to Right of Screen** (fullscreen two windows side by side as a “space”)
**Move Window to Left Side of Screen** and **Move Window to Right Side of Screen** (move the window to fill up the left or right half of the screen (these menu items are shown when the alt key is held in the Window menu)
**Enter Full Screen** (performs the macOS full screen as a “space”— the default shortcut is cmd+ctrl+f, but you can pick your own here)
**Zoom** (executes a “maximize” for some apps)

The keyboard shortcut recorder there will let you pick any shortcut, but if they conflict with a shortcut that’s built into macOS then it won’t work. Some easy ones I chose were “ctrl + alt + ←” and “ctrl + alt + →” because they are pretty unlikely to conflict with anything else. Avoid the shift key as a modifier as it can make the animations go in slow motion.

Not all apps have these menu items in their “Window” menu, so those apps won’t respond to these keyboard shortcuts
