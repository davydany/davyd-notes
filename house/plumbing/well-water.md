# Notes on Well Water

## Overview

The well water system, atleast in our house, consists of the following components:

* **The Well** - Source for the ground water
* **Motor** - this gets the water into the house
* **Pressure Tank** - gives pressure to the water entering the house
* **Filters** - depending on your water content, a set of filters in series purifies the water before sending it to the house
  * **Sedement Filter:** - This comes first, and removes the largest particles in the water (~25um)
  * **Active Carbon:** - We don't have this yet, but from what I am reading, this removes smell in the water (like sulfur) if the amount is small enough.
  * **Water Softener:** - This removes hard minerals from the water, and the outcoming water is softer and easier on our skin


The plumbing, in our house atleast, uses PVC piping.
