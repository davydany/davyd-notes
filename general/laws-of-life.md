# Laws of Life

## Personal Laws

These are laws that I believe work in reality, and I wanted to share them

### The Law of Complexity

> The size of the problem you're trying to figure out is inversely proportional to the time you are spending to figure 
> it out.

I kind of stumbled on this while working as a Software Engineer but it applies to every aspect of life. In debugging a 
problem, if a bug is a big bug, you'll discover the source of the bug quickly. Therefore, if you're 
spending a lot of time trying to find out where this bug is, chances are, it is a very small bug and which is why 
you can't find it yet.

I discovered this while trying to debug software applications, but this applies to other aspects of life too. If you're 
fixing an electrical or plumbing problem, this applies there too. 

This applies to personal issues between people too! If you're trying to figure out why someone is being hard on you, 
chances are, it is over some small trivial thing that you need to ask them questions to figure out the issue.

### The Law of Perception

> People perceive the world how they perceive themselves.

In my experience, if someone is complaining about life all the time, chances are they see that complaint in themselves,
and see the world the same way. Fixing how they perceive themselves, will help fixing how they perceive the world. This 
holds true to our individual selves too. If you are finding an issue someone in life, just take a quick second to 
see if it is really a bad thing, and if it is really an issue or if it is something that you just need to change your
percetion on. Sometimes it might be a genuine issue with that person but it can also be just our perception.

### The Smile Law

> A little smile goes a long way

Start your conversations with anyone with a smile, and especially if it is a stranger. Getting rid of your bitch face 
and starting with a smile helps them ease up and communicate more with you.

## Murphy's Law

> "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."

Murphy's law is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong." In some 
formulations, it is extended to "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and at the worst possible time.

## Conway's Law

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the 
> organization's communication structure.

Conway's law is an adage that states organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure. It is 
named after the computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1967.

The law is based on the reasoning that in order for a product to function, the authors and designers of its component 
parts must communicate with each other in order to ensure compatibility between the components. Therefore, the technical
structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organizations that produced it, across which 
communication is more difficult. In colloquial terms, it means complex products end up "shaped like" the organizational
structure they are designed in or designed for. The law is applied primarily in the field of software architecture, 
though Conway directed it more broadly and its assumptions and conclusions apply to most technical fields.
