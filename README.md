# davydany's Notes 

## Motivation

I created this repo and github page to put my notes up online. I got sick and tired 
of putting my notes in OneDrive, Google Keep and Apple Notes and then searching for
them. So, as XKCD explained it <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/" target="_blank">really well</a>, 
I thought I'd create another new note taking place... which is this.
