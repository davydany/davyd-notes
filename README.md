# davydany's Notes 

## Motivation

I created this repo and github page to put my notes up online. I got sick and tired 
of putting my notes in OneDrive, Google Keep and Apple Notes and then searching for
them. So, as XKCD explained it <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/" target="_blank">really well</a>, 
I thought I'd create another new note taking place... which is this.

Also, as a software engineer who likes to do way too many things, and then coming back later to 
do something else, I like to document naturally really well. I figured my thoughts, and notes would
help others, which is why I created this.
